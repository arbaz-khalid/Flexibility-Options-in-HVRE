# Solar & Wind Energy Self-Sufficiency and ROI Analysis

This repository provides **interactive Jupyter notebooks** and Python scripts to:

1. **Analyze building (or city-level) energy consumption** and on-site generation (e.g., solar PV, wind turbines).
2. Compute **Self-Sufficiency Rate (SSR)**, **Return on Investment (ROI)**, and other key performance metrics.
3. Visualize results using **Plotly** (interactive graphs and 3D surfaces).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores **strategies** to improve energy **self-sufficiency** (reducing grid purchases) through:
- **Solar PV and Wind Turbines** for local generation.
- **Battery storage** to store excess energy for later use.
- **Financial analysis** to compute **ROI**, operational costs, and economic feasibility.

### 🔹 Key Features:
✔ Compute **Self-Sufficiency Rate (SSR)** – How much of the demand is met locally?  
✔ Analyze **PV & Wind penetration ratios** – How much generation is installed vs. demand?  
✔ Optimize battery **storage capacity** for better grid independence.  
✔ Financial evaluation – **Return on Investment (ROI)** and savings.  
✔ **Interactive plots & sliders** using **Plotly** for real-time analysis.
